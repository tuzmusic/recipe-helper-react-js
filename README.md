# Recipe Helper

This is an app in progress. To try it out, install the packages:

```
npm install
```

And start the app!

```
npm start
```

Your browser should open up with the app running. You can also point your browser to `http://localhost:3000/`.

Currently, you can:

- see a few sample recipes
- Move step-by-step through the directions
- Check off ingredients

**MUCH** more to come! Like...

- Create your own recipe
- Import a recipe from any website
- Make changes to a recipe
- Start timers as directed in the recipe instructions
- Check off ingredients from the step they're used in (instead of just from the ingredients list)
- Adjust portion sizes
- More complex ingredient managing (e.g., checkboxes for "Got it!", "Prepped it!", "Used it!")
